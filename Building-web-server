Sudo update everything first

Yum install httpd
Yum install mysql

Create index.html file and store it in /var/www/html/index.html

sudo systemctl status httpd to check if apache is running
sudo systemctl start httpd to start apache; To restart type restart. Must do this every time a change is done. 
sudo systemctl enable httpd to start apache at boot

Changed permissions on the www folder to 777 so I was able to upload any media to website. 

Allow apache (http) through your firewall. 

ip a to check the IP of centos.
nmap -sT [IP ADDRESS HERE] to check open ports. 
	yum install nmap if you donâ€™t already have nmap
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all to check all allowed services.
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent to add httpd service to your firewall.
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent to add secured http.
sudo firewall-cmd --reload to reload your firewall

Once everything was in place, I created the index file under the var/www/html folder for apache.
