Sudo update everything first

Yum install httpd
Yum install mysql

Create index.html file and store it in /var/www/html/index.html

sudo systemctl status httpd to check if apache is running
sudo systemctl start httpd to start apache; To restart type restart. Must do this every time a change is done. 
sudo systemctl enable httpd to start apache at boot

Changed permissions on the www folder to 777 so I was able to upload any media to website.
