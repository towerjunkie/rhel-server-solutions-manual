In order to install rdesktop (Remote Desktop Protocol) I first opened port 3389 on the firewall. 
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=3389/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl start firewalld
install rdesktop – because centos and RHEL do not include rdesktop I had to get it from another directory online. 
sudo rpm --import http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/RPM-GPG-KEY-nux.ro 
sudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm    
sudo yum install rdesktop
Now I went to the target windows machine and enabled remote desktop usage.
Now to connect to the windows machine use command:
rdesktop -u (username) (hostname)
To check what version of rdeskptop installed to confirm:
rdesktop 2>&1| grep Version


To install xrdp from the EPEL repo:
rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server
systemctl start xrdp
xrdp should now be listening on 3389. You can confirm this by using:
netstat -antup | grep xrdp
Now in order to get xrdp to run at start up use the command:
systemctl enable xrdp
Finally, adjust your firewall settings to allow that port.
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3389/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
Configure SElinux
chcon --type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp
chcon --type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman
And to test the utility open your remote desktop app on windows, verify your root identity and accept the discrepancies of the certificate and you’re in.
