Install samba and necessary packages
sudo yum install samba samba-common samba-client
Open windows CMD and use command net config workstation to confirm an existing workstation. 
Make a copy of the conf file just in case. 
mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.con.bak
mkdir -p /srv/samba/shared
chmod -R 0755 /srv/samba/shared
chown -R nobody:nobody /srv/samba/shared
chcon -t samba_share_t /srv/samba/shared
Create the new conf file and add the following:
emacs /etc/samba/smb.conf
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Samba Server %v
netbios name = centos-8
security = user
map to guest = bad user
dns proxy = no

[Anonymous]
path = /srv/samba/shared
browsable =yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
read only = no
Test to see if everything is in order. 
Testparm
firewall-cmd --add-service=samba --zone=public --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl start smb
systemctl enable smb
systemctl status smb
systemctl start nmb
systemctl enable nmb
systemctl status nmb
Go to windows again and hit the windows key + R. Write in the title we put with \\ before. 
\\centos-8 
You should be seeing the anonymous folder. Try going to /srv/samba/shared folder and put some files in there and see if they show up.
